             <H2> Cross Country </H2>
             <p>I have been a part of the cross country team all four years. I started running in 7th grade, so that I could run 13 miles for my 13th birthday. Joining the highschool team was the first time I enjoyed running so much though. Right now I'm trying to improve my 5k times.</p>

             <H2> Crafting </H2>
             <p>My friends and I just started getting into craft days. It's so fun to get together and dye clothing, sew, draw, and make jewlery.</p>

             <H2> Hangin'out with my pets </H2>
             <p>I have many animals. Whenever I'm stressed or sad, seeing them calms me down.</p>
             <H2>Hottubbing </H2>
             <p>I need to do this more because it's a great hang out place and relaxing.</p>
             <H2>Backpacking </H2>
             <p>Every summer, my family goes backpacking in a new place. It's cool to be in nature and be outside all day.</p>

             <h2> Goals </h2>
             <p>I want to enjoy the things I am doing in my life. Right now I am persuing that in the future by applying to colleges. My short term goal is to start and finish applications before the due date, and get in somewhere I am excited about. </p>
