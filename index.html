         <h2> Personality</h2>
         <p>In school and when I am in new situations, I can be pretty quiet. But when I am with my friends and having fun, I am louder. When the moment is right, I'll even drop a few puns. I am very serious about school. I try to do my best in everything I do.</p>
         <h2> Fun Facts </h2>
         <p>My go-to fun facts are that I have a twin and a goat. Sometimes people can't tell my goat and I apart, but I'm used to it.</p>
         <h2> Goals </h2>
         <p>I want to enjoy the things I am doing in my life. Right now I am persuing that in the future by applying to colleges. My short term goal is to start and finish applications before the due date, and get in somewhere I am excited about. </p>
